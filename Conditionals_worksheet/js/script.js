//Group 1 - Celsius to Fahrenheit converter - Convert a temperature to either degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit depending on what the user has entered. If the user puts a “C” for the unit, the calculator should convert to Celsius. If the user puts “F” for the unit, the calculator should convert to Fahrenheit.

//F to C = Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
//C to F = Multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32
